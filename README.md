# Dynamic Table Using React and Mock API

This project demonstrates how to create a dynamic table in a React application based on array values fetched from a Mock API. The table automatically generates headers and rows based on the structure of the data returned by the API.

## Features

- Dynamically fetches data from a Mock API.
- Automatically generates table headers and rows based on the array's structure.
- Displays a loading state while data is being fetched.
- Handles scenarios where no data is available.
- User-friendly and easy-to-extend implementation.

## Technology Stack

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Mock API**: Simulates an API endpoint to provide dynamic data.

## Mock API Details

We use the following Mock API for data:
